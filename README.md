# [Project Name] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: eNThelum

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Nandana Sudheer - Government Engineering College, Thrissur
- Member 2: Terin Thomas - Government Engineering College, Thrissur

### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
A smart lock system for high-access areas (like labs) that can be unlocked via a physical keypad using time-based random codes (TOTP) generated by a web authenticator, eliminating the risk of lost physical keys.

### The Problem statement
Labs have locks and the access is required by many, physical keys are easy to lose and hard to keep track of.

### The Solution
The admin can decide who has access and can create credentials for them, the credentials create random codes that change every 30 seconds to open the door. At the same time the admin also has track of who all requested for the code. In case an approved user admitted another individual, they can mention it to the admin through comments.

## Features

List the key features of your project:
- Feature 1: Time-Synchronized Security: Uses NTP to sync hardware and server time, ensuring generated codes match perfectly.
- Feature 2: Multi-User Management: Admin dashboard allows creating/deleting up to 5 users, each with a unique secret key.
- Feature 3: Offline Operation: Once synced, the hardware can generate and verify codes without an active internet connection using the RTC.
